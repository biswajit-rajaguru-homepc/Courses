 git add boths tracks and stages the file.
 git commit commits the staged files, it is like changing the repository.
 a file might be tracked, but not staged. this is useful f you donot want to commit a tracked file in its present state.
 git commt -a both stages all tracked files and commits them.
 for common use,

1. if you to update sync your local file system with repo, then add . -A , then commit -am
2. if you want to only stage a particular file, add <file> assuming the file is aldready being tracked.
then git commit. btw git commit does need a list of files. it just commits what has been staged.

git pull will sync my state with repo state in :local: github
git config --global pull.rebase false
